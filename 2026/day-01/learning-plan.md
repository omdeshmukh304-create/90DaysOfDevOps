My name is Om Sanjay Deshmukh, and I am a second-year IT Engineering student at Pillai HOC College of Engineering and Technology.
My primary goal over the next 90 days is to become job-ready in DevOps by building strong technical and professional skills. I am actively focusing on Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, as these tools are in high demand across modern organizations. Alongside technical expertise, I am also working on improving my communication skills and building a strong, professional LinkedIn profile.
Due to my college schedule, I dedicate 1.5 to 2 hours on weekdays to consistent learning and hands-on practice. On weekends, I invest 4 to 5 hours in deeper study, project work, and skill enhancement. I strongly believe that consistent effort, practical implementation, and continuous learning will help me achieve my goal of securing a DevOps internship and becoming industry-ready
