# Day 22 – Git Workflow Notes

## Difference between git add and git commit
git add moves the changes to staging area while git commit permanently saves the changes into repository history.

## What staging area does
The staging area works like a preparation zone where we select which changes should be included in the next commit instead of saving everything directly.

## What git log shows
git log shows commit id, author name, date and commit message. It helps track project history.

## What is .git folder
.git folder contains all repository data including commits and branches. If deleted, the project loses all version history and becomes a normal folder.

## Working directory vs staging area vs repository
Working directory contains current files we edit.
Staging area holds selected changes before commit.
Repository stores permanently saved project history.
